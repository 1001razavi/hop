/**
 * This setup is recommended for modern projects that have multiple packages at the root
 * (i.e. src and test). This allows for full TS compatability in and between all packages,
 * including autocompletions and intellisense.
 *
 * The important piece is that teach package is its own TS project and uses references
 * to access the build of the other packages.
